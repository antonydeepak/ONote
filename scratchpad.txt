Objective:
    Get a rough ass prototype

Prototype:
    The usability should mimic the webpage that's it. No optimization and no shit!!

Status:
    Have got all the notebooks from the web and show in  a treeview
    First take on access model:
        We'll follow the parent child model of the returned data from onenote and model the same way
        notebooks 
            Section Groups
                Sections
                    Pages
                        Subpages
            Sections
        We have to handle the click handler of each tree node in tree view to load the respective child items.
            For ex, on clicking the notebooks node, the get_sections() & get_sections_groups() should be called and so on..
